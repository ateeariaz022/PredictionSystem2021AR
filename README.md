A. Prediction System

1. You need Internet Connection to access the files. 

2. You would need to install Anaconda on your PC where Jupyter Notebook can be accessed:(latest link below for Windows and Mac users):

https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual 

or alterntaively use Jupyter Notebook online( latest link below):

https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/jupyterlab-jupyterlab-demo-ahe1ohyp/lab

3. Import files into the Notebook:

PredictionSystem1.ipynb = the code file
survey - Copy.csv = The CSV file with data

4. Install Libraries:
mlxtend = on one field, add 'pip install mlxtend' and press shift and Enter together.

The code should be published: click on shift+ Enter to run each code and see the results on each code line.
5. At the end, the results of the predictor will be saved as results.csv

6. If you are using the online version, it would need to be manually exported into your PC. 

7. Another file will be saved as submission.csv to analyse with other co-members in the future. 


On the first line of code after installing the libraries, double press shift+enter to remove the error. 

Note: The time elapsed may take longer to load, so give it time. 

The code should be published: click on shift+ Enter to run each code and see the results on each code line.

More: if anything needs installing try the pip method. 

Need: could need these alternatives if preffered
